# DoIT
Suite of apps to consume short instructions on mobiles or wearable.

This project is to allow formatting of tutorials, instructions, and checklists in a format easy to consume on a mobile wearable. A variety of wearables can consume these instructions, so that scientists, engineers and/or astronauts can easily work with instructions while they are in the field whatever platform they are using. A reference implementation is provided for iPhone/iPad/iWatch.
